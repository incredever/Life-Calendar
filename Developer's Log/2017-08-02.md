Developer's Log, 2017-08-02

10:46 AM: I have a grid of tiles displaying on screen. I have a column of year labels displaying along side it. But neither is hooked up to any temporal information. The tiles don't know what week they represent. So I've given them each a span: TimeSpan property. This property needs to be set when I generate each tile. So Grid needs to be able to create progressive week long TimeSpan values.

11:22 AM: I created a little structure called TimeSpan, which represents a span of time between two Dates. Turns out [DateInterval](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateinterval) exists. Welp... I'm too lazy right now to rewrite everything, so I'll just continues using my thing for now. 🤷‍♂️
