Developer's Log, 2017-07-04

11:44 AM: Bindings, Document-based Applications, AppKit, SceneKit, SpriteKit, Swift 4. It's a lot to learn all at once. Too much, actually. I have been feeling extremely unproductive. Now, of course, there have been other outside life type factors – but I still think it's too much.

So there are a few options:

1. Pivot to targeting iOS - a platoform I know very well already.
2. Do away with bindings. I don't think I can really lose any of the others. SpriteKit, perhaps. But that's an easy one if I'm already doing SceneKit.
3. Build the entire thing using SpriteKit - limit my useage of AppKit and other Cocoa frameworks I don't know too well.

Okay - now let's talk through those options:

1. I don't want to do this because I badly want to build a mac app. However, it would speed things up with much less learning to do. But that's not a good enough reason for me. The mac is kinda the holy grail to me right now.
2. 
3. This sounds appealing because it means simplifiying down to 2D graphics, and also doing less learning - just get really good with SpriteKit, and build everything else myself. But it may be far fetched. Perhaps I really will be forced to use all the other Cocoa technologies anyway. And perhaps thats actually the right thing. Those long standing fameworks exist for a reason.
