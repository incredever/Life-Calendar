> “There’s lots of ways to be as a person, and some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands, you never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species, our deep appreciation." – Steve Jobs

[Commit 11:31]    Use the Layout Anchors API for titleTextField's top layout
[Commit 11:44]    Get a startDatePicker onscreen and properly constrained
[Commit 11:54]    Set the start date picker's date value to the event span's starting date
[Commit 12:03]    Create a startDateChange(to:datePicker:) method to the EventDetailsChangeDelegate protocol
[Commit 12:04]    Set the target-action for the startDatePicker and create startDateChange method for the EventView

12:05 PM: Re `EventDetailsChangeDelegate`: It feels super hacky to send a referance of the control from whence the change came in order to call `row(for:NSView)` in the conformance implementation. I am thinking about reworking the timeline and event models so that every event has a unique id and the timeline can conveniently fetch it for you.

[Commit 12:33]    Add a UUID to the Event struct
[Commit 12:37]    Turn Event into a class
[Commit 20:14]    Stub out an  event(for id: UUID) -> Event? method on Timeline
[Commit 20:15]    Implement event(for:)
[Commit 20:43]    Rename startDateChange(to:datePicker:) method name in EventDetailsChangeDelegate to change(startDate:forEventId:)
[Commit 20:44]    Make Event's span property variable

8:44 PM: TODO:
- [ ] Rename EventDetailsChangesDelegate to EventEventsDelegate
- [ ] Merge GridBasedEventChangesDelegate into EventEventsDelegate

[Commit 20:50]    Rename EventDetailsChangeDelegate's titleChange(to:textField:) method requirement to change(title:forEventId:)
[Commit 20:54]    Rework the table view handler's EventDetailsChangeDelegate extension to use the new change(title:forEventId) method
[Commit 21:09]    Rename EventDetailsChangesDelegate to EventEventsDelegate
[Commit 21:12]    Create new method requirement for EventEventsDelegate called new(event:)
