Developer's Log, 2017-09-07

10:45 AM: I've decided to remove the comment headers from all the .swift files. It just repeats the file name, project name, author name, and creation date. All that seems unnecessary and redundant, especially when you have source control enabled. and removing it it's one less thing in the visual field when looking at code.

11:53 AM: Right now I'm going to spend some time away from code. I'll make very thorough designs for how the whole sidebar event editing thing will look and behave.

Then I will figure out how to properly change the appearance of a table view cell view when hovering. I think I already did this, but it got mixed up in my mind with all the other table view related stuff I've been working with the last view days. I need to focus on one specific thing at a time.

And put on hold the questions of:
- How to edit the labels
- How to go into an edit mode
- How to add constraints to a cell view while it's frame is still zero
- Etc.
