Developer's Log / 2017-06-21

12:00 PM: You can now click and pan to change the colors of cells. I will now begin cleaning up the timeline model structs.

5:33 PM: I want to release Life Calendar 1.0 to the Mac App Store by July 21, which is exactly one month away.

There is *a lot* of design and development that needs to happen in that time. But I believe it is possible if I leverage some of the powerful aspects of doing this as a solo project. Such as:
- No meetings
- No training or guiding junior devs (which has been a significant time suck in past projects)
- The design iteration cycle will be shorter because it only has to go though me*
- I can ignore some of the formalities / best practices that you must to adhere to when working on a collaborative codebase (branching structure, issue tracking, unit testing, code reviews, etc.). Things may get messy, but hopefully in a good way.
- In past projects I believe I have not worked at my absolute top productive capacity. If I am able to (consistently) get myself into that awesome tip-top level of focus, I think I could increase my typical daily output by perhaps 20-40%.

*Which could be a problem, because it can take awhile for me to back up and gain an objective perspective on a design - sometimes days or weeks. So this is a liability. I could become gridlocked by an inability to make a final decision.
